description: Elyx is a design tool with local, AI-friendly `.elyx` files for screens, components, layouts, flows, and design systems. MANDATORY Use this skill before you read, reason about, or answer any question about Elyx or `.elyx` files. That includes authoring, editing, validating, inspecting, reviewing, refactoring, comparing, and recommending changes, and read-only analysis that produces no edit. Do not reason about `.elyx` files from source text alone. Imports, instances, overrides, and layout resolve only through the `elyx` CLI.

## How to work in Elyx

This workflow uses the `elyx` command from the public `@elyx-design/cli` npm
package. Before you work with Elyx files, run `elyx --version` to confirm that
`elyx` is on your `PATH`. If it is not, ask the user to install it. For
example:

```bash
npm install --global @elyx-design/cli
```

If a CLI error suggests the CLI is older than the project, such as an unknown
field in `elyx.json`, tell the user in one line: update the Elyx app if
`elyx` came with it, or update `@elyx-design/cli` if they installed it
from npm.

For the authoritative list of flags, run `elyx --help` or `elyx <subcommand> --help`.

### Use `find` and `tree` to see the resolved scene

Use `find` and `tree` to read the scene after imports, instances, overrides, layout, and geometry resolve:

- `find --ref`: get the final data and bounds of one layer by its exact ref.
  `elyx find path/to/file.elyx --ref ctaButton`

- `find --at`: get the topmost rendered layer at a board-space point.
  `elyx find path/to/file.elyx --at 420,180`

- `find --in`: get the layers that intersect a board-space rectangle, or that the rectangle contains.
  `elyx find path/to/file.elyx --in 0,0,800,600`
  `elyx find path/to/file.elyx --in 0,0,800,600 --contain --click-through`

- `tree`: get the semantic layer tree of a file, or of one internal source ref, with children, instance source references, layout, position, constraints, text, and style.
  `elyx tree path/to/file.elyx --ref OnboardingWelcome`
  `elyx tree path/to/file.elyx --ref OnboardingWelcome --depth full`

The results use these conventions:

- `localBounds` is geometry in the layer's own space. `absoluteBounds` is geometry in board space.
- In the tree, `position` is the resolved local placement. `constraints` are the stored values that drive layout.
- A value bound to a design token appears as `{"value": …, "token": "<file>#<group>.<member>"}`. The token is the same in every context.
- `instanceOf` gives an instance's source `file`, `symbol`, and `variant`.
- A code layer has `code` instead: the React component it renders, as `file` and `export`, and its `props`. The tree omits the layers it renders.
- Slot nodes include `slot: true`. Other nodes omit it.
- The tree depth accepts `shallow`, `full`, or a non-negative integer. An integer limits how many instance boundaries the tree crosses.

### Start code from `css`

When you implement a design in code, start from `elyx css` instead of recreating styles from `tree` output. It writes one class per rendered layer, with token references, stack layout, positioning, and clipping resolved. Add `--format json` to get each rule's declarations and the layer `target` it styles.

`elyx css path/to/file.elyx --ref OnboardingWelcome`

### Name things the way users do

When you describe or name Elyx objects, follow these rules:

- Say “layer”, “component”, or “screen” for visual design objects.
- The declaration symbol before `=` is the layer’s name. Keep its leaf name concise, semantic, valid Elyx syntax, and consistent with the project. Do not add a separate `name:` property.
- Use the optional `title:` string for a human-readable label independent of the symbol. Keep the symbol stable when only the label changes.
- Use the optional `caption:` string for a short explanation of a screen or example, such as its purpose or the state it demonstrates.
- Say “symbol” for source identity, imports, references, arguments, and renames.
- Say “token” for design tokens. Say “variable” only for other reusable values that are not layers.

### 1. Orient

Before you assume anything from source examples, use `elyx man` to learn Elyx syntax, concepts, properties, and component semantics. `elyx man` prints the overview manual. `elyx man <topic-or-schema-path>` prints one topic, such as `elyx man components`, `elyx man instance`, or `elyx man frame.width`. If you do not know the right path, run `elyx man --list`.

### 2. Author

The project usually already has a design system and its own file vocabulary.
Reuse and import its existing building blocks. Do not build a parallel system.

Prefer composition to recreation. Import and instantiate existing components
instead of rebuilding them from raw layers.

If the project has React components, code layers can place them on the
canvas directly, so a design can start from what the codebase already has.
Code layers are a work in progress. Read the `code-layers` documentation
before you use them.

To learn how Elyx projects are organized, run `elyx man project-structure`.
To learn component composition and override semantics, run `elyx man components`, `elyx man instance`, `elyx man variants`, and `elyx man slots`.
To learn how to place React components as code layers, run `elyx man code-layers`.

When you add or change structure, follow these rules:

- Before you write a property you have not used yet, read its documentation. Elyx ignores a property it does not know.
- Import shared components, tokens, and blocks where you can.
- When you create or link a variant, use `@variant` on an instance of its base. It already behaves as a component; do not enable the inspector's Component option (add `export`) just to make it a variant. Export it only when it needs to be reusable outside its file, such as an external variant offered in another file's variant picker.
- Use stacks and `.auto` sizing for normal interface layout. The `frame.layout` documentation describes them.
- Keep overrides local and intentional.
- Add `title:` and `caption:` where they help explain top-level screens or component examples, not on every layer. Keep existing annotations unless the task calls for changing them.
- Capture titles and captions semantically with `title:` and `caption:` so the canvas can draw them as annotations. Do not add separate text layers around a screen or example to represent its title or caption. Text that belongs inside the interface still uses text layers.
- For icons and other vector artwork, write a small SVG file and import it as an asset. The `assets` documentation shows how, including tinting it with `fill`. Do not substitute arbitrary Unicode characters for icons. For SF Symbols with a text representation, use the verified character and explicitly select a compatible SF font. Verify that it contains the glyph.
- Rename symbols one source file at a time. Before you move on, repair the local references and all direct and transitive consumers.
- Before you reason about instances or overrides, read the resolved structure and geometry from the tree.

#### Leave space between canvas items

When you place separate screens, frames, or component examples on a board,
leave at least 48px between the edges of adjacent items. Aim for a gap of at
least 20% of the larger item’s size along the spacing direction. That is the
width for items side by side, and the height for items stacked vertically. For
example, two 1920px-wide screens side by side need about 384px or more between
them, not 48px.

The 20% target is a guideline, not a rigid rule. Keep spacing consistent
within groups, and leave room for frame titles. To measure gaps, use the
resolved bounds of the items. To review the arrangement, render it. This
guidance covers the space between distinct canvas items. It does not cover
padding or gaps inside a screen or component, or intentional overlaps. Do not
re-space unrelated content unless the user asks.

### 3. Render the result

```bash
rg -n --glob '*.elyx' '@context\s*\(' .    # find the context axes and values in the workspace
elyx render path/to/file.elyx -o <tmp>/out.png
elyx render path/to/file.elyx --context theme=dark -o <tmp>/out-dark.png
elyx render path/to/file.elyx --context theme=dark --extra-file path/to/theme-dark.elyx -o <tmp>/out-dark.png
elyx render path/to/file.elyx --ref <name> --context theme=dark --context lang=pt -o <tmp>/out.png
```

Use `render` whenever the visual result matters. Do not assume that a `.elyx` change is correct from its source text alone.

A render is for you to look at, not part of your work. Write it to a temporary directory outside the repository, shown as `<tmp>` above, then view the PNG. Do not save renders in the project or commit them unless the user asked for the image files.

To render one layer, use `--ref <name>`. To render with custom contexts without changing the source file, repeat `--context axis=value`. To load files that the rendered file does not import, repeat `--extra-file <file>`. A `--context` selection changes the output only after the file that declares the context is loaded. Without the matching `--extra-file`, the render silently falls back to the default values. Before you render, search the workspace's `@context` annotations to learn the available axes and values.

When the file has code layers, `render` prints their render warnings to stderr, such as CSS that code layers don't support. Warnings aren't diagnostics. `elyx man code-layers` explains how to read them.

The `render` scale defaults to 1. Add `--scale 2` only for fine detail, because it produces four times the pixels.

### 4. Check the changed files

When your edits are done, normalize each changed file in place. Then check the
changed files for errors and warnings.

```bash
elyx normalize -w path/to/file.elyx
elyx diagnostics path/to/file.elyx   # with no target, checks the whole project
```

Check the smallest scope that covers the changed files. Resolve every warning,
or account for it explicitly.

If normalization reports that it fell back to syntax-only formatting, the file
loaded with problems, so it was only formatted. Fix the problems it lists,
then normalize the file again.
